# Open Source Smoker Control Unit
Code for using smoker damper with Pi or arduino control unit

Essentially I was loaned a Smoker with a damper but no control unit so what better way to spend my free time than make my own control unit

## Prerequisites

- [Adafruit MAX31855](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3328)
- A damper controllable via PWM
    -the damper that came with my smoker is [this](https://smobot.com/products/smobot-robotic-damper-w-o-controller)
- A K Type Thermocouple (I use [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748BQ3YL?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details))
